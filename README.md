# GitHubReposSearch

# Notes:
- Pagination was assumed to start at page 0
- the api provided doesn't support search, thus all the repos were fetched once, cached, and then search was done locally.
- the api provided doesn't have any data relevant to creation date of the repo as stated in the task, thus was skipped.
